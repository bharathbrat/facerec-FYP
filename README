Design and Analysis of various face recognition modules.

eigenfaces.py - implements Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
	Here, the average vector for the images in the database is obtained.
	The individual vectors for a face image are subtracted with average vector to 
	the principal components (eigenvectors) for that face image. These eigenvectors 
	are then projected to a subspace and are used to find the best match.
